# Addressing Algorithmic Bias in Recidivism Score Predictions

## Overview
This project aims to mitigate the inherent bias in recidivism score predictions generated by the National Institute of Justice. The existing algorithms tend to exhibit biases towards gender and racial/ethnic groups, which can have profound implications on the lives of individuals affected by these predictions. We are leveraging innovative machine learning techniques to rectify and minimize these biases.

## Problem Statement

Recidivism scores play a crucial role in the criminal justice system, but they can perpetuate societal biases. This project aims to develop a fair and unbiased algorithmic decision-making model, focusing on gender and racial/ethnic groups.

## Key Features

- **Bias Mitigation Techniques:** Utilizing cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify and mitigate biases in recidivism score predictions.
  
- **Fairness Evaluation Metrics:** Implementing rigorous fairness evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance across different demographic groups.

- **Transparency and Explainability:** Prioritizing transparency in the model's decision-making process and providing explanations for predictions to enhance accountability.
